# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The goal of this project was to produce an intuitive and user friendly weather application. The user can get the current weather as well as a five day forecast for the city they search. They can also view their previous searches.

## Usage

The website has a search input and button that, when pressed, dynamically produces the current weather, and a five day forecast. Searches are also stored as buttons underneath the search button, so the user can click and view their previous searches.
